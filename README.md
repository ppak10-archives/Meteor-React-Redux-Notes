# Meteor-React-Redux-Notes
###### Notes on adding [Redux](https://redux.js.org) to [Meteor's tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) on creating a todo app that integrates both [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) and [React](https://reactjs.org)

## Getting Started
Once cloning the repository, to get started type the following commands to start the server.

If running the server for the first time locate the Meteor-React-Redux-Notes directory and type in, otherwise skip directly to the run command:
```
./install.sh
```
After installing the necessary node packages, start the server by typing in:
```
./run.sh
```
This should start the server on the default port and you should be able to access it through your browser by typing in the url:
```
localhost:3000
```
